//! Packet-data channels of several slots (`[packet_data] pdch_max_slots` > 1) on the main
//! carrier: what the scheduler does for them besides sharing one downlink queue.
//!
//! The radios that use them (the MXP600) are frequency half duplex without fast switching: they
//! cannot receive while they transmit and need up to one slot to switch (EN 300 392-2 23.1.3.1.1,
//! 23.1.3.1.2). At the BS the uplink frame starts two slots after the downlink one (9.3.9) and the
//! uplink slot labelled u is on air while downlink slot u+2 is, so a radio holding uplink u does
//! not receive downlink u+1 (switching), u+2 (transmitting) and u+3 (switching back). On a channel
//! of two or more slots the BS should not send it anything then (23.1.3.1.1 last paragraph,
//! 23.3.1.2.2 NOTE 2, 23.5.2.2.7):
//!
//! - G1: a downlink slot of the channel its radio does not hear (an uplink slot of its channel
//!   reserved to it at d-1, d-2 or d-3, or the slot right after the one that carried its channel
//!   assignment, 23.5.4.3.1) carries nothing of the channel queue;
//! - G2: while it holds uplink slots of its channel ahead, no downlink fragmentation starts (the
//!   MS drops a partial TM-SDU after N.203 slots without a fragment, 23.4.3.1.1 iii);
//! - a random access of the radio on its channel, which the BS learns of only after the downlink
//!   slots around it went out, drops the fragmented downlink message under way (23.4.2.1.1) and
//!   frees the uplink slots granted in those slots.
//!
//! Uplink capacity the radio asks for on its channel is not granted when the request arrives but
//! when a downlink slot of the channel it hears is built (as Nexus-BS grants pending capacity at
//! transmission): the MS counts the granting delay from the slot that carries the grant, over the
//! slots of its channel (23.5.2.2.2), and which slot that is depends on G1, on frame 18 and on the
//! queue. One debt per channel, the radio's whole requirement less what it already holds ahead
//! (23.5.2.1 NOTE 1), granted in chunks of up to four slots; frame 18 is counted but never
//! granted; no grant while a downlink fragmentation runs on the channel (G3, the grant would
//! break it), and at a message boundary the debt goes first. Once the radio says it has nothing
//! more to send, the slots it still holds are freed (23.5.2.3.1).
//!
//! An advanced link segment that asks for an acknowledgement is granted, with it, a full slot
//! for the answer (23.5.1.3.3, 23.5.2.2.1 b): an AL-ACK sent by random access would be known only
//! once the downlink slots around it went out, a reserved one is covered by G1.
//!
//! With one slot per radio none of this applies.
//!
//! On the packet-data carrier (`[packet_data] pdch_carrier`, a carrier without MCCH) a channel
//! may also hold ts1, and has four slots at most:
//!
//! - its uplink never uses ts1 (the adjacent-channel copy of a burst there would land on the MCCH
//!   uplink of the cell): ts1 is an opportunity the MS counts but never a granted slot, and its
//!   AACH shows the uplink reserved;
//! - the radio arrives from the main carrier's MCCH: it is sent nothing before the first downlink
//!   slot of its channel after the assignment, and taken as transmitting (its linearisation
//!   burst) in the first uplink slot (23.5.4.3.1 rule 1 a, 23.5.4.3.4);
//! - on four slots frame 18 leaves four channel slots without a fragment, which may already be
//!   N.203 (">= 4", annex B.2): no downlink fragmentation starts in frames 14 to 17 (G4), and the
//!   reply slot of an acknowledgement request is four opportunities away.
